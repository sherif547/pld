# CodeWave Programming Language
CodeWave is a programming language designed by Me.
It is a simple language that supports basic programming constructs like variable assignment, arithmetic operations, loops, conditionals, and switch statements.

# Grammar
The CodeWave grammar consists of the following terminals and non-terminals:

## Terminals
* `identifier`: A string that starts with a letter and may contain letters, digits, and underscores.
* `int`: An integer.
* `float`: A floating-point number.

## Non-terminals
* `<program>`: The starting symbol that represents a CodeWave program.
* `<constant>`: A non-terminal that represents a constant declaration or assignment statement.
* `<assignment>`: A non-terminal that represents an assignment statement.
* `<assignment_op>`: A non-terminal that represents an assignment operator.
* `<declaration>`: A non-terminal that represents a variable declaration.
* `<for_assignment>`: A non-terminal that represents a for loop assignment.
* `<for_inc_dec>`: A non-terminal that represents a for loop increment or decrement.
* `<expression>`: A non-terminal that represents a boolean expression.
* `<statement_list>`: A non-terminal that represents a list of statements.
* `<add>`: A non-terminal that represents an addition operation.
* `<sub>`: A non-terminal that represents a subtraction operation.
* `<div>`: A non-terminal that represents a division operation.
* `<mul>`: A non-terminal that represents a multiplication operation.

# Usage
To use CodeWave, write a program in the CodeWave language using the grammar rules above, and then compile or interpret it using a CodeWave compiler or interpreter.

# Example
### Here is an example CodeWave program that calculates the factorial of the number 5 and outputs the result:
